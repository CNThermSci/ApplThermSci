Rod dynamic force and momentum equilibria
also gives, for the

F_cry component of the crank upon the rod,
in which the bold I_cry is a row-vector
whose components have units of inertia,
with m_rp and y_rp shown.

It is worth noting that the I_crx and I_cry
row-vector components are very complicated
functions of the base quantities, due to
the nesting definitions.
