Letting further rgâ‰¡Lg/L, then the
accelerations of the shown components
centers of mass can be derived
and compactly written as in the previous
slide, in which the new row-vector
coefficients are shown.

It is worth noting that, due to nesting of
definitions, derived row-vector coefficients
are increasingly complicated functions of
the primitive parameters and variables.
