The motivation for the work is to create a
dynamic extension of a somewhat recently
published FTHA model, which is an

air-standard reversible, finite-time
heat release model for spark-ignited
engines, that is a

minimal-complexity, pure-substance model
including simultaneous heat and
work interactions, that... (differs...)
