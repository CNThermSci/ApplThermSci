Now, instantaneous engine speeds, œâ(t) in RPM, are
shown for the same cases.

The thermodymanically- and dynamically-driven regimes can
also be observed by comparing subfigures (i) and (ii),
since œâ(t) is obtained by a time integration of ùñ≥(t),
according to the previously shown equation for œâÃá.

In the subfigure (i) on top, the net thermodynamic work
energy input---which is the heat energy input multiplied by
the thermal efficiency---is responsible for the increased
engine RPM at the end of the cycle compared its initial
value; hence, the unloaded engine acceleration.

The same can be said on subfigure (ii). It is worth noting,
however, that the cycle increase in engine RPM is smaller for
the high-RPM case, since kinetic energy is proportional to a
corresponding velocity squared, for translation and rotation.
