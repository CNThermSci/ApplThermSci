The j-iterative solution procedure for the i-th
thermodynamic model process is laid out.

By taking (modeling) all process as being locally
polytropic ones with exponent n_i, initial polytropic
exponent guesses can be iteratively corrected after
the process work, and final internal energy,
temperature, and pressure are found, by the
correcting equation shown at the bottom, thus
closing the thermodynamic model.
