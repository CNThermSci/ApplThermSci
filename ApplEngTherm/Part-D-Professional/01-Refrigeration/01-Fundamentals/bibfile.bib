  abstract  = {This essential up-to-date revision of ASHRAE's Fundamentals of Refrigeration addresses the three major areas of refrigeration: comfort cooling (air conditioning), commercial refrigeration, and industrial refrigeration. Each of twelve chapters builds stepwise in a logical progression from an understanding of basic principles to a consideration of practical details to their implications in commercial applications. Skill Development Exercises at the end of each chapter help readers assess their understanding of the material and apply what they learn to real-world situations. Answers to to these exercises can be submitted to earn PDH, CEU, or LU credits. Fundamentals of Refrigeration is an indispensable introduction to refrigeration for engineering graduates who wish to broaden their expertise, as well as veteran technicians seeking to brush up on current theory and practice.},

  abstract = {Solid-liquid equilibria at ambient pressure and solid-liquid-vapor equilibria at T=303.15 K have been measured in the system ammonia-water-lithium bromide for various initial concentrations of lithium bromide. Liquid phases have been analyzed using ion selective electrodes. A ternary phase diagram of the system at T=303.15 K is provided showing a triple line and several regions in which solid phases of different kind occur. This will restrict considerably the use of these systems as working fluids in absorption machinery.},
