Whenever the piston is at the TDC and at the BDC for
a fixed, given engine angular speed, the piston-rod-
crank mechanism is at kinetic energy minimum states.

Moreover, when the thermodynamic system is at working
fluid inlet conditions of ambient temperature and
pressure, it is at internal energy minimum states.

All points circled in red present these commom conditions.
The fact that the engine angular velocity, and therefore
its kinetic energy, being local, consistent maxima
attest energy conservation.

Moreover, the afct that the cycle begins and end at the
same state also attest energy conservation.
