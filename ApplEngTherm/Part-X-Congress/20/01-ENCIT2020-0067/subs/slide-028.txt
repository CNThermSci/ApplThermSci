Reported model results include the following,
“Single-Cycle No-load Acceleration” case, in which
a full cycle is performed with 400 kJ/kg of
specific heat energy input at 64 linearly distributed
initial engine RPM, in the interval of 112.5 RPM
up to 7200 RPM, as shown.

The figure on the right shows the resulting simulated
Andrews---or, P-v---diagrams for two selected initial
engine speeds of 1125 and of 4162.5 RPM, respectively.

Since the heat-input interval and ignition angle were
kept constant at ∆tc = 4 ms, and θ = −15°, as shown,
in the low-RPM case, the heat input is relatively
quick enough as to cause the pressure to rise well
above the ignition pressure---recalling the scale is
logarithmic.

In the higher-RPM case, the heat input is relatively
slow enough as to cause very little departure from
compression process pressures right after ignition,
and only later on displaying a departure, thus causing
the maximum working fluid pressure to decrease with
increasing engine RPM (again, for all other parameters
fixed).
