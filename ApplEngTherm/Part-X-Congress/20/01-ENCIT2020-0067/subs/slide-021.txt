For model Kinematics, force and momentum
equilibrium equations are employed.

Solid body exchanged forces have three subscripts,
respectively representing the (i) action component,

In this work, solid-body exchanged force indices refer to the \emph{action} of  the  element
indicated by the first index onto the one indicated by  the  second  index;  while  a  third
index, if present, refers to a Cartesian direction component; for instance, $F_{rpy}$, shown
