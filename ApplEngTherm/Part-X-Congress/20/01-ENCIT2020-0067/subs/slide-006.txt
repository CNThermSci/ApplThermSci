In the shown tests, crankshaft angular span
during the heat release time interval
parameter δ (delta) increases from 10°,
in warmer colors, to 110°, in colder colors,
representing situations of progressively higher
engine speeds with respect to heat release
times with all other parameters fixed.

Results show that as engine speed increases,
the resulting P-v cycle diagram transitions from
a pointy, ideal Otto-cycle looking, to
smoother, experiment looking ones, with
decreasing maximum attained working fluid pressure,
increasing exhaust temperatures (not shown),
and decreasing thermal efficiencies.

These illustrate quite a prediction capacity for
a simple, pure-substance, reversible model, and
one may wonder what predictions can also be made
by incorporating basic engine dynamics to it.
