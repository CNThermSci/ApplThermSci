Conclusions are:

1. Results show that the model is able to predict:
    - instantaneous torque and angular speed;
    - the coupled cycle P-v behavior;
    - the thermal efficiency and
    - cycle-averaged torque;

2. Many energy transfer modes are accounted for;

3. The model has a reasonable amount of design and application input parameters;

4. The model can thus serve as a teaching resource in advanced engineering classes;

5. Or as a departure point for more complex equilibrium models in research:
