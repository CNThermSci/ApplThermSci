Now, instantaneous engine speeds, ω(t) in RPM, are
shown for the same cases.

The thermodymanically- and dynamically-driven regimes can
also be observed by comparing subfigures (i) and (ii),
since ω(t) is obtained by a time integration of 𝖳(t),
according to the previously shown equation for ω̇.

In the subfigure (i) on top, the net thermodynamic heat
energy input is responsible for the increased engine RPM
at the end of the cycle compared its initial value; hence,
the unloaded engine acceleration.

The same can be said on subfigure (ii)
