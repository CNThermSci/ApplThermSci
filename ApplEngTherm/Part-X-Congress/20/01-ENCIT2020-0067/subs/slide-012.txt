The discrete energy balance is shown, along with
the heat-release modeling through a normalized,
cumulative heat input function y(α), and the
cumulative heat input signature function g(α).

Profiles for g(α) can be taken from available
literature or from experimental measurements.

The auxiliary t* is just a shifted, proper cycle, time.
