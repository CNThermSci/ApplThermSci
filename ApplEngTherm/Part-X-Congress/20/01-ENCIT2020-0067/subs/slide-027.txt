Further more, the fact that the one-thousandth cycle
is the same as the first one, attest long-term energy
conservation in the iFTHA model.

There seems to be only one plotted curve, because the
first and one-thousandth cycles exactly match to within
the high plot resolution shown and included in the article.

Other validation cases are either included or
source-cited in the article.
