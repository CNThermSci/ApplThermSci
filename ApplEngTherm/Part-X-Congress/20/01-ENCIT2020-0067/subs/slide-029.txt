Now, instantaneous torque histories, ùñ≥(t), are
shown for the same cases.

In the subfigure (i) on top, the thermodynamic
cycle is responsible for the widest instantaneous
torque variations, and for same-sign torques
along the compression and expansion stokes, as
usually expected---meaning negative torques during
compression strokes and positive ones during
expansion strokes, with some lower-amplitude dynamic
oscillations during exhaust and admission strokes.

This yields a sort of thermodynamically-driven
torque regime.

In the subfigure (ii) on the bottom, however, at
this RPM we seem to be just passed a transition in
which the dynamic torque oscillations amplitudes are
greater than the thermodynamically-driven ones.

We surprisingly see positive instantaneous torques
at the end of the compression stroke---meaning rod
and more likely piston decelerations alone provide
more than enough for working fluid compression.

Moreover, the exact reverse happens on the first half
of the expansion stroke, meaning rod and chiefly piston
accelerations demand more than the working fluid is
able to instantaneously provide, thus making negative
instantaneous torques to appear.
