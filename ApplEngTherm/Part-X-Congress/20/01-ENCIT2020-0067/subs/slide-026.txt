Whenever the piston is at the TDC and at the BDC for
a fixed, given engine angular speed, the piston-rod-
crank mechanism is at kinetic energy minimum states.

Moreover, when the thermodynamic system is at
working fluid inlet conditions of ambient
temperature and pressure, it is at internal
energy minimum states.

All points circled in red present these commom
conditions. The fact that the engine 

Energy conservation means the available initial
system energy
