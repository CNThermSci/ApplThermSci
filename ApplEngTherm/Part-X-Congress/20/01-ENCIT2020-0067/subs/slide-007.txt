So the strategy is to make a model merge between
the FTHA one and a suitable dynamic model.

Available constant-velocity dynamic models, which
essentially constitutes one-way couplings with
the thermodynamic model either tend to be

(i) very simple, having lumped,
translation-only components; or

(ii) be substantially more complex, having
external dependencies, or including elasticity;

A model that was found to be quite fitting as
to be coupled to the FTHA model was the 
(iii) variable-velocity---hence two-way coupling---
rigid body inertial model due to Montazersadgh.
