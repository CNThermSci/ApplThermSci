  abstract  = {This essential up-to-date revision of ASHRAE's Fundamentals of Refrigeration addresses the three major areas of refrigeration: comfort cooling (air conditioning), commercial refrigeration, and industrial refrigeration. Each of twelve chapters builds stepwise in a logical progression from an understanding of basic principles to a consideration of practical details to their implications in commercial applications. Skill Development Exercises at the end of each chapter help readers assess their understanding of the material and apply what they learn to real-world situations. Answers to to these exercises can be submitted to earn PDH, CEU, or LU credits. Fundamentals of Refrigeration is an indispensable introduction to refrigeration for engineering graduates who wish to broaden their expertise, as well as veteran technicians seeking to brush up on current theory and practice.},
