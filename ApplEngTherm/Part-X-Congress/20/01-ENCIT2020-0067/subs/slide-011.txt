The instantaneous piston position, x,
is shown as a nonlinear function of the
crankshaft angle α (alpha),

which is shown to affect the working fluid
thermodynamic system volume, V, as well as
the intensive thermodynamic property of
specific volume, v (lowercase).

Moreover, the time discretization is laid
out, and the consequent crankshaft angle
one for short-Δt (Delta-t).
