For model Kinematics, force and momentum
equilibrium equations are employed.

Solid body exchanged forces have three subscripts,
respectively representing the:

(i) action and (ii) acted upon parts,
and the (iii) cartesian direction.

The F_rpy force applied by the (r)od onto the
(p)iston in the (y)-direction is derived and
expressed as shown, also with a vector-vector
multiplication term.

The F_g is the force due to the
GAUGE pressure of the working fluid
with respect to the crank case,
P_g = average system P - P_cc, in which
P_cc is the crank case pressure.
