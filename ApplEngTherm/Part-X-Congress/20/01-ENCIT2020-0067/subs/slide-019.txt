For model Kinetics, the shown R- and L-
hypotenuse right triangles are key.

The dot notation for time derivatives
are used throughout.

Letting B≡R/L, βx≡h/ℓ=tan(φ), and
βy≡r/ℓ=tan(φ)/tan(α), then the relations below
for the angular acceleration of φ can be
derived and compactly expressed, as shown,
in Linear Algebra vector-vector multilpications
of a coefficients row-vector,
indicated by bold 'a',
with an angular velocity-derived column-vector,
indicated by bold-'Ω',
with ω² and ω̇ components.
