Finally, the corresponding engine torque curve,
understood as cycle-averaged torques in terms of
cycle engine initial RPM, is shown.

There is SOME curve shape resemblance to experimentally
obtained torque curves, in the sense of having a generally
negative second derivative---seen by the overall downward
curve concavity---and a resulting global maximum torque
value; however, one does not attempt in making further
comparisons, as the test set kept all other parameters
---chiefly the (i) input heat energy per cycle and the
(ii) heat input time interval---constant, which significantly
differs from actual engine test and usage conditions.

The point is showing that a very simple, equilibrium, pure
substance, reversible, plane motion, inertial model is able
to produce an engine torque curve, and consequently, also
an engine power curve (not shown).
