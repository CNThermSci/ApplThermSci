From crankshaft force momentum equilibrium one can write
the engine crankshaft angular acceleration, ω̇, in terms of
a total torque 𝖳, over a "total" inertia I_tot, as shown.

The total torque 𝖳 can be split into static and dynamic
torque components---𝖳_s and 𝖳_d, respectively, in which the
static component is due to the gauge working fluid force
on the piston head, F_g, shown on the second line, whilst
the dynamic one is due to moving part inertias at constant
angular velocity and proportional to ω².

The "total" inertia is the sum of the piston-rod inertias
due to engine crankshaft angular acceleration, ω̇, and
the crank and flywheel inertias, I_c + I_f.

A (bold) I_pr vector can be contructed as shown in the
last line, whose definition involves both the I_crx and
I_cry inertia row-vectors, which, as was pointed before,
are complicated functions of the basic quantities.

At any given combined thermal and dynamic engine state,
all quantities on the right-hand-sides are known, so that
