Another, “Multiple-Cycle No-load Acceleration” case study
with the model, with similar input parameters as the
validation test, except for 600 kJ/kg of heat energy input
per cycle and a combined crank-flywheel inertia of 100 kg·m²
accelerating from 1000 to 4000 RPM, produces the shown
results in terms of engine angular velocity, ω(t), and cycle
thermal efficiency versus initial cycle RPM, η_t(ω_0):

With increasing engine angular velocity, cycles become more
frequent, and heat energy is added at increasing rates,
i.e., at higher average heat-powers, and so does the
(equivalent) fuel consumption---which, by the way, is NOT
simulated in an air-standard model---and the rate of
additional kinetic energy storage within the engine.

During such a regime, cumulative energy storage is
predominantly quadratic with time, which explains the
predominantly linear increase of engine angular velocity
with time on the left side of the figure.

Moreover, the thermal efficiency is shown to decrease with
engine RPM, which is an already expected outcome of the
previsouly published thermodynamic-only FTHA model.
